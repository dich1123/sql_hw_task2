SQL task (task2)
-

- You can find all commands of creating tables in creating.sql
(use task2_dump.sql for creating db, tables and inserting data. )
- WARNING. You can use random_data.py for inserting data into tables, but 
it's not recommended (you can get empty answers for some queries).
- Use queries.sql to run all queries from task2
